# ⌨️ Caps lock indicator for KDE Plasma
## Why i'm Making this
Just for comodity, since my laptop lacks of leds for the caps and num lock functions.
## How i'm making this?
I'm making this in C++ to get a better performance, also, i'm using parts of Plasma's source code (shell/osd.cpp) to get the feeling of a Plasma default function.
## Why not just a Plasmoid or KWin script?
Since KDE Framework for desktop doesn't allow keyboard events detection in background (Only shortcuts), this program will be a "Daemon" running in usermode, just a background process.
## Compilation
